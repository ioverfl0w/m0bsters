(h2p) Mobsters is a statisitcal game where you purchase properties to increase revenue, join together with other plays to form mobs to improve your chances of survival, buy items to increase your accuracy when attacking, and more.
(h2p) A list of available commands can be found using "help". A public-only command means that it must be executed in #mobsters, while a private-only command must be done via PM.
(h2p) Every 50 minutes, your income and upkeep will be added to your cash balance. Any cash you hold is at risk of being taken when you are attacked, so use the bank if you'd like to keep your money safe.
(h2p) The wisest thing to do for new players is to invest in property. This will return you money every payday, on top of attacking other players will help you obtain more funds so you can raise higher into the ranks!
