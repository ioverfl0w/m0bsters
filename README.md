# m0bsters
mobsters irc game

m0bsters is an IRC remake of the classic game Mobsters, which you may have played on either your phone or on a social media website. Complete with missions, properties you can buy which earn you income, items that help your bonuses in attacks and mobs you can create or join to help you improve your numbers. This game is a lot of fun when there are a good amount of players interested in playing.

As the m0bsters bot system uses my novabot1 frame, you can adjust most of the immediate settings within "run.py." From the bot names and whether or not they identify, along with the game channel and the OP channel for managing the game. Access for bot control is based off of whether the user is identified and their access level within the bot's files (./data/access.dat). Items and properties for the game can be tweaked in their respective files in (./data/mobster/data/). If you find a series of values that are more appropriate than what I had (because balancing games is not my forte), please feel free to let me know.

Starting the game is as easy as "python run.py". Just open a tmux or screen session and detach, and you're done! Get on IRC and join the set location you've specified, and you have yourself a mobsters game.
